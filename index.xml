      <description>This article will be continuously updated to reflect changes made in the game during implementation and to be aligned with other articles.  
Intent I don&amp;rsquo;t make a goal to create a game that will be world-wide popular. Moreover, I realize that game creation alone is a really hard task and generally it is done by a game studios. Therefore, I will focus on plain and something simple like oldfashion 2D games.</description>
