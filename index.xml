      <description>Previous articles were focused on how to serve the user with a smooth animation, but there was no word how to create it. This article aims at fixing this. I will review browser capabilities to draw an animation and mention some specific aspects that should be taken into consideration during its creation.
How can we draw in a browser? There are at least three approaches available:
 CSS Animation HTML animation using JavaScript Canvas  CSS Animation.</description>

      <description>Loops in JS. There are several posibilities to organize loops in JavasCript, the most common are:
 for statement do &amp;hellip; while statement while statement  They are pretty known, therefore, I think, I will not describe them here. What I really want to point here is that these statements do not perfectly suit requirements of game development. There are a lot of things that should be built around these statements manually; the main of them is frames synchronization (for more details on the synchronization please see Computer Graphics article).</description>

      <description>When I was writing articles related to a game loop I realized that they don&amp;rsquo;t describe what a frame is and why the frame rate is so important. To fix this, I decided to write this article and place it in the begining.
Frame. Wikipedia gives quite short and understandable definitions for different things, therefore I use it with great pleasure. So, what does it tell about a frame?</description>

      <description>Before I provide you with a definition of a Game Loop I would like to look at some corner concepts.
What is a Computer Program? What a strange question? Everyone knows the answer! I can agree with that statement, but do you really know what computer program is in essence? After ten years in software development and thousands lines of code I&amp;rsquo;m re-thinking this question.
 A computer program is a collection of instructions that perform a specific task when executed by a computer.</description>

      <description>This article will be continuously updated to reflect changes made in the game during implementation and to be aligned with other articles.  
Intention. I don&amp;rsquo;t make a goal to create a game that will be world-wide popular. Moreover, I realize that game creation alone is really a hard task and generally it is done by a game studio. Therefore, I will focus on something plain and simple like oldfashion 2D games.</description>

      <description>Implementation of the gameplay requires from us understanding of how games work under the hood and what a game engine is. In this set of articles I&amp;rsquo;ll review basic concepts related to both these topics in the context of JavaScript:
 Computer Graphics articles describes what a frame is and why the frame rate is so important Game Loop article describes what a game loop is and what it is used for.</description>
