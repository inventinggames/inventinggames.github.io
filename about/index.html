<h1 id="welcom-to-my-blog">Welcom to my blog!</h1>

<p>My name is Alexander Krupsky. I have worked as a SharePoint Tech Lead and .Net Solution Architect for a couple of the last years. I have had a lot of amaizing opportunities and great projects that allowed me to improve my knowladge and skills in wide range of fields. But, I have figured out that inspite of my good understanding of high-level design concepts I have a lack in low-level implementation details. I have considered several ways how to solve this issue and chosen to stop on a game development exploration. Why? Because game development utilize many pattern and approaches that are highly concentrated on vital software aspects such as availability, performans, fault-tolerance and usability. Also, I truly believe that learning through game development it is fun.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-the-blog-about">What is the blog about?</h1>

<p>My goal is to improve my knowladge of low-level implementation details and languages capabilities, therefore I&rsquo;m going to implement everithing from scratch and don&rsquo;t use any existing framework. It means that I will describe here the whole path (from the engine implementation to multi-player game releas) and issues appeared on the way.</p>

<h1 id="programming-languages">Programming Languages</h1>

<p>For the client part of the game I have chosen JavaScript. I have chosen it, because: firstly, I have good experience in a web development; secondly, it run on the browser that is available approximately on every device; thirdly, JavaScript exploration can add value to my day-to-day work.</p>

<p>Language for the server side of the game I will choose in the future (it&rsquo;s realy hard choice!). But for now I will use C# in some of my examples.</p>
